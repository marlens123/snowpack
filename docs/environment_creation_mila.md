# Creating a Virtual Environment on the Mila Cluster

On the Mila cluster, both `venv` and `virtualenv` can be used to create a virtual 
environment.

First, load the python module:
```
module load python/3.10
```

Then, for `venv`:
```
python3 -m venv <PATH_TO_ENV>
```

or for `virtualenv`:
```
virtualenv <PATH_TO_ENV>
```

where `<PATH_TO_ENV>` is the path where the environment will be created. It normally 
should be inside your project's folder (but ignored by git), and commonly named `.env`, 
`.venv`.

You can then activate your environment using the following commandline:

```
source <PATH_TO_ENV>/bin/activate
```

After the environment is created and activated, follow the [Poetry Instructions](../README.md#poetry)
